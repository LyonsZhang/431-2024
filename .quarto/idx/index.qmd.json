Register and enroll via the [CWRU Student Information System (SIS)](https://sis.case.edu/). Note that Section 100 of PQHS 431, CRSP 431 and MPHP 431 are identical.\n2.  Review this main course website, being sure to visit the [Course Calendar](calendar.qmd).\n3.  Skim through the [Course Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/431-syllabus-2023/).\n4.  Obtain a copy of David Spiegelhalter's *The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data*, originally published in 2020 and available at all major book retailers for around \\$20.\n5.  Complete the [Welcome to 431 survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey), as described below.\n6.  Get started [installing the software](software.qmd) you'll need for the course.\n7.  Sign up for the (free) [Campuswire discussion forum](campuswire.qmd).\n\n### Welcome to 431 Survey\n\nPlease fill out the [Welcome to 431 Survey](https://bit.ly/431-2023-welcome-survey) to help us get to know you a little better.\n\n-   You must **log into Google via your CWRU account** to access the survey.\n-   The survey should take 15-20 minutes to complete, and we encourage you to do so now.\n-   Thanks to those of you who've already completed the survey.\n\n## Class Starts 2023-08-29 at 1 PM\n\nClass will be held on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 1:00 - 2:15 PM in Room E321-E323 at CWRU's School of Medicine, starting on 2023-08-29.\n\n-   The [Course Calendar](calendar.qmd) is now available.\n-   The course will be held in person, rather than online, but we will make recordings available whenever possible for those who need to miss a session. Do not come to class if you are sick.\n\n## Pep Talk!\n\nLearning R can be difficult at first - it's like learning any new language. Hadley Wickham, the chief scientist at Posit (makers of RStudio) and the author of some amazing R packages you'll be using like `ggplot2` [made this wise observation](https://r-posts.com/advice-to-young-and-old-programmers-a-conversation-with-hadley-wickham/):\n\n> It's easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, \"Oh it's me, I'm really stupid,\" or, \"I'm not made out to program.\" But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It's just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don't blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you're finding yourself struggling or not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask us for help, etc. If you've spent 15 minutes working on something and are stuck, don't keep working on it, and instead **ASK FOR HELP**. I promise you can do this.
