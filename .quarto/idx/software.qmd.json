Download and install **the latest version of R** (version **4.3.1 or later**) from [https://cran.case.edu/](https://cran.case.edu/) or, if you prefer, from [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/) which automatically chooses a fast, nearby mirror for you.\n    - If you have a pre-existing installation of R and/or RStudio, we highly recommend that you re-install both to get current.\n2.

We want to hear from you!\n\n## Updating Your R Packages\n\nEvery once in a while, it's a good idea to update your R packages. To do so, \n\n1. Go to the **Packages** tab on the right side of your RStudio screen, and click on **Update**.\n2. This will bring up a dialog box. I usually click **Select All**, then click **Install Updates**. \n\n- A popup box may appear, asking \"Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?\" to which I usually answer **No**.
